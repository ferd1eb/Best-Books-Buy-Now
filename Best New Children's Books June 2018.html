Fiona was the first baby hippopotamus born and raised in captivity. She was an underdog from the start: she couldn't nurse, she couldn't stay hydrated,  and she wasn't thriving. But the staff at the zoo were confident that they could save her. It would take creative thinking and teamwork. They would have to study the composition of hippo milk the first time ever. They would have to reach out to medical colleagues to ensure that Fiona would begin to gain weight and become healthy. When Fiona began to thrive, her popularity grew quickly. She became an internet sensation. Her pictures and videos garnered thousands of likes and fans on Instagram and Facebook. Why is this little hippo such a big hit with people all over the world? What does the future hold for this amazing hippo?</p>
<p class="review">Thane Maynard, the director of the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden, wrote this book. It includes full-color photographs of Fiona and the staff at the zoo.</p>

They unsuccessfully attempt conversation over dinner, but the grandfather speaks only in Thai, and the boy speaks in English. Sitting in uncomfortable silence, the awkward boy walks away to doodle on paper. He draws a wizard with a wand and a red hat in the shape of a cone. The grandfather, recognizing the creative outlet, fetches a sketchbook. Surprisingly, he draws his version of a wizard: an intricately detailed warrior clothed in traditional Thai ceremonial dress. The young boy is impressed, amazed that they "see each other for the first time." The two begin a battle of imagination, pencils and paintbrushes thrashing like swords. One draws in lively colorful cartoons, the other with fierce black-and-white brushed drawings. They join forces against the dragon that divides them, and build a new world together.</p>

The kids are not impressed with Penelope's efforts to make friends. The whole class is afraid of her, except Walter the goldfish.

Olive now announces that she'll "be brave for both of us." She repairs the rip and she leads both of them safely home. The artwork makes the story come alive, rendered in watercolors, pen, and ink, with colors added digitally.</p>

He relishes his high position and the treats that come with it. But one day, a brown-faced child appears with a shiny bobble-headed competition... a high-flying giraffe-shaped balloon! Giraffe and balloon attempt to outdo each other until the giraffe appears to be the loser. Leopold exacts explosive revenge against the upstart balloon, but victory is only temporary. The brown-faced child re-appears with a whole bunch of giraffe-shaped balloons! Alas, the kid trips, loses all the balloons, and Leopold faces a moral dilemma. But all ends well for the giraffe and snacks and the boy and his balloons. The author deals with the serious issues of jealousy and decision-making but is treated comically.</p>

In this story, Shorty gets caught up in playing his own music that he arrives late for the band's performance and parade. He disappointedly finds that the band left without him. He is so disappointed with himself, that he is sure he will never become a bandleader after letting down his own band members. Feeling dejected, Shorty roams the streets of New Orleans, looking for his band. Along the way, he chanced upon three New Orleans institutions -- musician Tuba Tremé, Creole chef Queen Lola, and a troupe of Mardi Gras Indians -- who help him understand the elements of success. Each one shares his own wisdom with Shorty about being an artist, a leader, and a friend.</p>

They imagine all of the horrible fates that could have befallen their favorite pets: Have they been kidnapped by a robot? Or eaten by a dog? Or stolen? Or carried off by birds? Gemma and Dilla decide to carefully look through the neighborhood and post fliers in search of their beloved pets.  As expected, they run into each other in an uproarious fashion.</p>

Every day he wakes up and sings a series of songs. When Little Robot has his breakfast, for instance, he sings:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 180px;"><em>Oats with oozy oil are yummy</em>
<em>slipping slowly down my tummy.</em></p>
<p class="review">But although his life is peaceful, he feels a little lonely. So what's a robot to do? Thankfully, this robot has determination and know-how, but can Little Robot build the perfect cure for loneliness?</p>
<p class="review">The authors' text practically screams to be read aloud. Their writing is further enhanced by the illustrator's inviting watercolor illustrations. This is certainly a book to cherish for years to come.</p>

But he is sure that he can overcome the pecking order of fifth grade. He dreams of the day when he evolves into "his true awesome self." A Category 5 hurricane cancels his vacation, and Frederick is pushed to the limit. He accepts a dare that sends him floating down a river without a paddle. He comes ashore at Camp Omigoshee, a disciplinary camp for boys. Frederick is mistaken for a camper (Dash) who hasn't arrived and whose bad reputation is much cooler than his own. Frederick keeps up the facade, and discovers that the other boys are also not what they seem, until the real Dash shows up. Then the story takes a spin as the hurricane hits.</p>
This fun, coming-of-age romp is full of zany, creatively-nicknamed characters (Frederick shares a cabin with Nosebleed, Ant Bite, Specs, and the Professor) coming together in a story of friendship among boys.

She learns that the kingdom is tormented by traitors, and that her responsibility is to help the king identify between friend and foe. But there are others who are able to disguise their dishonesty with cunning of their own. Only must steer through her new circumstances, where her greatest power can also be her greatest weakness.</p>
<p class="review">Heartseeker is labeled as Middle Grade, but is also wildly enjoyable for adults.</p>

Surprisingly, the snail eventually appears and carries Vernon into the next story. In "Fishing," Skunk and Porcupine join their friend. Porcupine feels inadequate because he doesn't know how to fish, but in reality none of them do. At the end of the story, lit by a sunset, the trio invents their own version of the sport. "Gardening" finds Vernon missing Bird. Working, resting, seeking out things Bird loved, and thoughtful friends are factors in his renewal.</p>

She lives in a small village in Punjab, Pakistan. She dreams of becoming a teacher and a poet. When she unwittingly insults Jawad, the son of her village’s wealthy and influential, but corrupt, landlord, Khan Sahib, she is coerced into indentured servitude with his family. Jawad promises Amal’s father that she will be “treated like all my servants, no better, no worse.” He also assures him that he will “let her visit twice a year like the others.” Once in her oppressor's home, Amal is subjected to Jawad’s insults, which are somewhat relieved by the kind words of his mother, Nasreen Baji, whose servant she becomes. Amal remained optimistic by reading poetry books that she surreptitiously sneaks from the estate library. She also teaches the other servant girls how to read and write. Amal ultimately finds a friend in the U.S.–educated teacher, Asif. She learns from him that the powerful aren't invincible.</p>
<p class="review">Saeed’s timely and rallying middle-grade debut is a celebration of resistance and justice. It is inspired by Malala Yousafzai and countless unknown girls like her.</p>

She lives in a small village in Punjab, Pakistan. She dreams of becoming a teacher and a poet. When she unwittingly insults Jawad, the son of her village’s wealthy and influential, but corrupt, landlord, Khan Sahib, she is coerced into indentured servitude with his family. Jawad promises Amal’s father that she will be “treated like all my servants, no better, no worse.” He also assures him that he will “let her visit twice a year like the others.” Once in her oppressor's home, Amal is subjected to Jawad’s insults, which are somewhat relieved by the kind words of his mother, Nasreen Baji, whose servant she becomes. Amal remained optimistic by reading poetry books that she surreptitiously sneaks from the estate library. She also teaches the other servant girls how to read and write. Amal ultimately finds a friend in the U.S.–educated teacher, Asif. She learns from him that the powerful aren't invincible.</p>
<p class="review">Saeed’s timely and rallying middle-grade debut is a celebration of resistance and justice. It is inspired by Malala Yousafzai and countless unknown girls like her.</p>
